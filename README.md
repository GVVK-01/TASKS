Repository Description:
This repository contains the results and code for performing Customer Segmentation using Clustering. The project focuses on segmenting customers based on both their profile information and transaction behavior using clustering algorithms. The following files are included:

clustering_report.pdf: This PDF report presents the results of the customer segmentation process, including the number of clusters formed, clustering metrics such as the DB Index and Silhouette Score, and visual representations of the clusters. It also provides insights and conclusions derived from the clustering analysis.

clustering_code.py: This Python script contains the code for performing customer segmentation. The script includes steps such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, clustering using the K-Means algorithm, evaluation using metrics like the Davies-Bouldin Index and Silhouette Score, and visualizations using PCA for dimensionality reduction.

The project leverages customer and transaction data to identify distinct customer segments, which can be useful for targeted marketing, product recommendations, and improving customer engagement strategies.
